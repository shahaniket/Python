Pandas is open source library built on numpy. It is python version of excel.

Series:
Series is similar to numpy array the difference is that Series can have dynamic/user indexes and Series can hold multiple data objects.
Data in series can be accessed using the given user index and also by the numeric index of the python.
pd_series = pd.Series(data) 
pd_series['a'] and pd_series[0] will print the same output for data = {'a':1,'b':2}

DataFrame:
DF is collection of Pandas series sharing same index(label). DF has the columns and rows indexes and we can retirve the data using these columns and labels.
DF can be accessed using index as well using columns.
To access columns we can directly pass the column name in the form of list to DF. (df[['A','B','C']])
To access rows we can two methods loc(label based retrival) and iloc(index based retrival)
